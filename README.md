# GitHub Emoji

Finally a complete list of GitHub Emojis.

Now you can search and use all emojis you want in your .md files, like this :cowboy_hat_face: or this :european_castle:.

## Development stuff

The project has been developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/).

I'm using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/github-emoji/actions) to build and deploy the website.
